            <p>The most important gift to us is having you share our special day. But if you wish to contribute in
                some other way, we would love some pennies to put in our pot, to put towards our honeymoon after
                tying the knot!</p>
            <p>A locked letterbox will be available at reception, and both EUR and GBP are equally appreciated. If
                you prefer to do a bank transfer, bank account details can be provided on request.</p>
